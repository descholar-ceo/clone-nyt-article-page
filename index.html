                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
                     with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up 
                    late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                </p>

                <p>

                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should 
                    have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe
                     bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
                      infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
                     swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                <p>
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from 
                    pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all
                     the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted 
                     beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

                      “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
                        and drew a double box around it.

                </p>
                <p>

                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they
                     had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
                     known undramatically as inflation, looked right.Reaching back across 13.8 billion
                      years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a>  with telescopes at the South Pole, 
                      a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
                       for Astrophysics detected ripples 
                       in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a>  
                        — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently 
                        apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of 
                        a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. 
                           Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
