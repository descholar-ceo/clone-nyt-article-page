                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
                     with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up 
                    late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.

                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should 
                    have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe
                     bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
                      infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
                     swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens
                     look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous 
                     ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing,
                     but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.He continued, 
                     “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
                      sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves

                    The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of 
                    microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the 
                    universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.

                    Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, 
                    for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their
                     results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics 
                    here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.
